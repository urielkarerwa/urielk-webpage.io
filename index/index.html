  <h2> Who am I&#63; </h2>
<p> At the heart of it all, deep in our bones, there's a love for storytelling. We're all storytellers, sharing our experiences, voicing our internal narratives, and exchanging our shared beliefs with one another.
Storyelling is disarming, natural and timeless. A process as old as language. These webpages tell the story of my profesional background told in the way of a young web designer. Consider this the start of my personal portfolio page. Keep coming back, I'm sure this site will be more esthetic, adaptive and accessible. <span>
Anyways, here's my story: </span></p>

 <h3> Where my Journey begins </h3>
  <img src="photos/grad-picture.jpg" alt="Grad Picture of Uriel with cap, gown and certificate">
  <p> I was told in the corporate world, one's professional story start after high school. So naturally my story begins in university. I spent 5 years studying neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge, learning from some of the most important minds in the field of neuroscience.
  I gained experience in research, and developed a neuroscientists work ethic (The answers out there, I just have to find it or come up with a theory and test it). In my final year I was on the dean's honor role for outstanding marks.
  This is where it all started, where I developed my curiosity and creativity. My intention is to maintain a blog, that you can find by following the link embedded in the button below.

  <h3> Public storytelling </h3>
  <!--<img src="photos/TEDx-mid-shot.jpg" alt="TEDx speech"> -->
  <p>To cap my formidable years studying neuroscience I was able to share my story on the TEDx stage.
 The theme for TEDx uleth was <span>'I am still learning'</span> and shared my story about how I made learning more personal, and in the process uncovered many forgotten events from
my childhood.</p>

<p>
While volunteering in public radio, I discovered how much I enjoy sharing in other's stories, struggles and life experiences.
In three short years contributing to my public radio station I was able to </p>
<ul>
<li> Host 2 radio shows and a podcast</li>
<li> Interview over 20 guests ranging from musiciens to scientists and even comedians</li>
<li> Succesfully DJ a live event</li>
<li> Accrue over 150 hours in radio and podcasting 
<ul>
<li> Recorded over 50 hours of spoken word content for radio and podcast </li>
<li> Nominated and won the volunteer lethbridge excellence award </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Honorable mention at the National Community Radio Award </li>
</ul>
<p> It all started with two friends and one very mediocre but exciting idea. 
&#8220; Hey, we should do a hip-hop show together, like on the radio&#8221; &#8208; Drew.</p>

<h3> My passions </h3>
<h4>
&#8220; To know thyself is to know the world you live in &#8221;</h4>
<p> My first love will always be psychology. I loved taking psychology courses in my undergrad and 
applying the sometimes self-helpy teachings from my human-behavioral classes.
<span> The next step for me was to deovte myself to bringing positive change into the world, as one strives for naturally with the skills acquired from university (to try and pay off those student loans).
I devoted two, long, COVID-filled years as a support worker for people with disabilities and various mental health concerns.
</span>
Service and impact are two cherished values that I do not see myself compromising (is this just apart of being a millenial). In my future job aspirations I see myself contributing to a cause that matches my values.
I recently discovered a field within tech and engineering that blends social impact with tech developement. Enter "Civic tech" a whole field devoted to making the world better through the design and implementaiton of technology for the good of the public, and often developed with the help of it's user base.
