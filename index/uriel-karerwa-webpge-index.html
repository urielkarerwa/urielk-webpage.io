  <h2> Who am I&#63; </h2>
<p> At the heart of it all, deep in my bones there's a love for storytelling. I think we're all storytellers, with rich lives that we can translate into stories to share with others.
Storyelling is disarming, natural and timeless. A process as old as language. <span>
Anyways, here's my story </span></p>

  <div class="education">
 <h3> Where my Journey begins </h3>
  <img src="photos/grad-picture.jpg" alt="Grad Picture of Uriel with cap, gown and certificate">
  <p> The story I'm chosing to share starts near the end of my university studies. I spent 5 years studying neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge, learning from some of the most important minds in the field of neuroscience.
  I gained experience in research, and developed a neuroscientists work ethic. In my final year I was on the dean's honor role for outstanding marks.
  This is where it all started, where I developed my curiosity and creativity.

  <h3> Public storytelling </h3>
  <!--<img src="photos/TEDx-mid-shot.jpeg" alt="TEDx speech"> -->
  <p>To cap my formidable years studying neuroscience I was able to share my story on the TEDx stage.
 The theme for TEDx uleth was <span>I am still learning</span> and shared my story about how I made learning more personal, and in the process uncovered many forgotten events from
my childhood.</p>

<p>
While doing public radio is when I discovered how much I enjoy sharing in other's stories, struggles and life experiences.
In three short years contributing to my public radio station I was able to </p>
<ul>
<li> Host 2 radio shows</li>
<li> Interview over 20 guests ranging from musiciens to scientists and comedians</li>
<li> Run a podcast </li>
<li> Succesfully DJ an event </li>
<li> Accrue over 150 hours in radio and podcasting 
<ul>
<li> Recorded over 50 hours of spoken word content for radio and podcast </li>
<li> Nominated and won the volunteer lethbridge excellence award </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Honorable mention at the Naitonal Community Radio Award </li>
</ul>
<p> It all started with two guys and one very mediocre but exciting idea. 
&#8220; Hey, we should do a hip-hop show together, like on the radio&#8221; &#8208; Drew. I find the show better when there&#8242;s two... Or a whole community</p>

<div class= "psych-love">
<h3> My passions </h3>
<h4>
&#8220; To know thyself is to know the world you live in &#8221;</h4>
<p> My first love will always be psychology. I loved taking psychology courses in my undergrad and 
applying the sometimes self-helpy teachigns of the human-behavioral classes.
<span> The next logical step for me was to deovte myself to bringing positive change into the world, as one strives for naturally post-graduation, and make a liveable wage.
I devoted two long COVID filled years as a support worker in addictions and mental health field.
